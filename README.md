</div>

---

`av` is a command-line tool that helps you manage your stacked PRs on GitHub. It
allows you to create a PR stacked on top of another PR, and it will
automatically update the dependent PR when the base PR is updated. Read more at
[Rethinking code reviews with stacked
PRs](https://www.aviator.co/blog/rethinking-code-reviews-with-stacked-prs/).

# Usage

> [!TIP]
> Complete documentation is available at [docs.aviator.co](https://docs.aviator.co/aviator-cli).

Create a new branch and make some changes:

```sh
$ av stack branch feature-1
$ echo "Hello, world!" > hello.txt
$ git add hello.txt
$ git commit -m "Add hello.txt"
```

Create a PR:

```sh
$ av pr create
```

Create a new branch and make some changes. Create another PR that depends on the
previous PR:

```sh
$ av stack branch feature-2
$ echo "Another feature" >> hello.txt
$ git add hello.txt
$ git commit -m "Update hello.txt"
$ av pr create
```

Visualize the PR stack:

```sh
$ av stack tree
  * feature-2 (HEAD)
  │ https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World/pull/2
  │
  * feature-1
  │ https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World/pull/1
  │
  * master
```

Merge the first PR:

```sh
$ gh pr merge feature-1
```

Sync the stack:

```sh
$ av stack sync

  ✓ GitHub fetch is done
  ✓ Restack is done

    * ✓ feature-2 f9d85fe
    │
    * master 7fd1a60

# Installation

`av` is available for macOS and Linux. In order to interact with GitHub, `av`
uses the GitHub API token. If you have [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/)
installed, `av` will use the token automatically from the GitHub CLI. It is
recommended to install both.

## macOS

```sh
brew install gh aviator-co/tap/av
```

## Arch Linux (AUR)

Published as [`av-cli-bin`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/av-cli-bin) in
AUR.

```sh
yay av-cli
```

## Debian/Ubuntu

Download the `.deb` file from the [releases page](https://github.com/aviator-co/av/releases).

```sh
apt install ./av_$VERSION_linux_$ARCH.deb
```

## RPM-based systems

Download the `.rpm` file from the [releases page](https://github.com/aviator-co/av/releases).

```sh
rpm -i ./av_$VERSION_linux_$ARCH.rpm
```

## Binary download

Download the binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/aviator-co/av/releases).

# Setup

1. Set up the GitHub CLI for GitHub authentication:

   ```sh
   gh auth login
   ```

   Or you can create a Personal Access Token as described in the
   [Configuration](https://docs.aviator.co/aviator-cli/configuration#github-personal-access-token)
   section.

2. Set up the `av` CLI autocompletion:

   ```sh
   # Bash
   source <(av completion bash)
   # Zsh
   source <(av completion zsh)
   ```

3. Initialize the repository:

   ```sh
   av init
   ```

# How it works

`av` internally keeps tracks of the PRs, their associated branches and their dependent branches.
For each branch, it remembers where the branch started (the base commit of the branch). When
the base branch is updated, `av` rebases the dependent branches on top of the
new base branch using the remembered starting point as the merge base.
